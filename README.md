# Climate-Change-Impact-Analysis-Using-Machine-Learning 
Climate change has emerged as one of the most pressing global challenges, with far-reaching consequences for ecosystems, economies, and human societies. The increasing frequency of extreme weather events, rising global temperatures, and environmental degradation necessitate advanced analytical techniques to assess and mitigate these impacts effectively. In recent years, machine learning (ML) has proven to be a powerful tool for analyzing climate data, identifying patterns, and making predictions that aid in decision-making processes. This study explores the application of machine learning methodologies to assess the impact of climate change across various domains, including temperature fluctuations, sea level rise, agricultural productivity, biodiversity loss, and extreme weather events. By employing predictive modeling and pattern recognition, this research aims to enhance the understanding of climate variability and inform policymakers about potential mitigation and adaptation strategies. The findings emphasize the importance of data-driven decision-making in climate action planning, offering insights into how emerging technologies can contribute to sustainable environmental management. Furthermore, this study discusses the limitations of machine learning models in climate science, including data quality issues, model interpretability challenges, and computational resource constraints.
